            Review this pull request. Focus on:

            1. **Correctness**: Are there logic errors, edge cases, or bugs?
            2. **Code quality**: Is the code clean, well-structured, and maintainable?
            3. **CLAUDE.md compliance**: Does this change follow the rules in CLAUDE.md? If it violates any, call them out specifically.
            4. **Compound learning**: Based on what you see in this diff, propose any CLAUDE.md additions or refinements that would prevent future mistakes. Format these as a separate "Suggested CLAUDE.md Updates" section.
            5. **Security**: Any secrets, credentials, or unsafe patterns?

            Be direct and specific. Don't pad with generic praise. If the PR looks good, say so in one sentence and move on.
